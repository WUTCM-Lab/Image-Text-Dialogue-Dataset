## Data image source
These datasets cover a variety of visual question answering (VQA) tasks, promoting the development of artificial intelligence in the fusion understanding of images, videos, audio, and text. 
They include MMChat and AVSD, which focus on multimodal dialogues, early VQA datasets DAQUAR and Visual Genome, FM-IQA, which supports multilingual question answering, and CLEVR and FVQA, which emphasize visual reasoning and knowledge combination. In addition, these datasets include VQA-Med (medical images) and ScienceQA (scientific fields) for specific fields, as well as TextVQA, which processes text information in images. Each dataset has its own unique focus and challenges, and each has promoted the progress of computer vision and natural language processing technology in different directions, from basic object recognition to complex scene understanding and multimodal interaction.
In total, these datasets contain more than 50,463,159 images and 50,680,872 dialogues, with a total dialogue time of 61,139.28 hours. These datasets can be used in a variety of artificial intelligence applications, such as virtual assistants, customer service robots, educational robots, etc., and have a wide range of uses in processing and understanding image-text dialogues.
